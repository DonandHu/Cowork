China ## 

Mainland Chinese stock markets advanced amid sustained bullish sentiment among retail investors. The onshore benchmark CSI 300 Index rose 1.38%, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 1.52%. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index also increased, climbing 3.82%. The CSI 300 Index recorded the largest single-day advance since March on last Thursday, driven primarily by domestic technology companies perceived as key beneficiaries of Beijing’s initiative to promote homegrown innovation.

China’s USD-denominated trade surplus expanded to USD103.bn in August, up from USD98.24bn in July. Exports grew 4.4% year-on-year in USD terms, missing market expectations of a 5.4% gain and marking the slowest expansion since February. Imports rose 1.3% YoY, falling short of the 4.3% forecast and decelerating from July’s 4.1% growth.


The Producer Price Index (PPI) declined 2.9% year-on-year in August, marking the 35th consecutive month of contraction, but also representing a narrowing of the decline from July’s 3.5% drop


Data indicated that deflationary pressures persisted within China’s economy. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined 0.4% year-on-year in August, lower than market expectations of a 0.2% decrease. This decline followed July’s flat reading (0% year-on-year) and marked a return to negative territory. While food prices contributed to the weakness, the deflationary trend was also driven by broader factors including sluggish domestic demand and intensified price competition

**In Asia**
Last week, four deals over US$50 million were priced in the Asian equity market, raising a total of US$0.8 billion.
Mainland Chinese stock markets rose in a holiday-shortened week. The CSI 300 was up by 2.0% for the trading week ended September 30. China's stock markets were closed from October 1 to October 8 for the National Day holiday and Mid-Autumn Festival. The Hang Seng Index rose 3.9%, largely fueled by the market's expectation of a Fed rate cut in October.
China's official manufacturing PMI improved to 49.8 in September from 49.4 in August, marking a second straight month of improvement. The new orders index reached 49.7, up from 49.5 in August, and the new export orders index also rose to 47.8, up from 47.2 in the previous month. On the other hand, the official non-manufacturing PMI fell more than expected to 50.0 from a reading of 50.3 in August.
China announced it would deploy policy-based financial tools worth 500 billion yuan ($70.25 billion) to accelerate investment projects as part of efforts to support the slowing economy, according to the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). The state commission also added that it was working with relevant parties to swiftly channel the funds to specific projects and would urge local governments to accelerate project construction.
**In the US**
U.S. equities were higher this week, more than recovering from last week's losses. The S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones were up by 1.1%, 1.3%, and 1.1% respectively, all reaching record highs. The U.S. government shutdown led to the postponed release of official economic data, while the market was inspired by the ADP payrolls report, which showed job losses in September. The market was looking at the possibility of further rate cuts amid the weakened job market environment. The US government shut down amid a funding standoff between Republicans and Democrats, leaving some federal services suspended and about 750,000 workers facing furlough. US President Donald Trump hinted that a federal government shutdown was an opportunity for layoffs. Markets largely shrugged off economic impact concerns, focusing instead on delayed data like Friday's jobs report. If the shutdown continues, other vital economic indicators provided by the government could be delayed, including the September consumer price index (CPI) report scheduled for October 15. This could make the economic situation less clear in advance of the Fed's policy meeting in late October.
In the absence of the BLS jobs report, markets focused on alternative labor market indicators. These included the September ADP data, which showed the economy losing 32,000 jobs. Consensus expectations had been for ADP to report 51,000 jobs added, so the weakness seemed to increase market conviction in upcoming Fed rate cuts.
The ISM Services PMI fell to 50.0 in September from 52.0 in August, missing market expectations of 51.7. This indicated a halt to economic growth in the vital services sector. The manufacturing PMI increased to 49.1 last month from 48.7 in August. It was the seventh straight month that the PMI remained in contraction territory.
**In Europe**
European equities were boosted by a rally in technology stocks and expectations of a U.S. rate cut this month. The UK's FTSE 100 Index and the pan-European STOXX Europe 600 Index rose by 2.2% and 2.9% respectively.
Eurozone headline inflation ticked up to 2.2% year-over-year in September, up from 2.0% in August. Core inflation rose 2.3% year over year in September, matching the pace of the previous four months. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde pointed out that the risks to inflation appear quite contained in both directions. The market widely expects that the central bank is unlikely to cut rates again in 2025.
In August 2025, the euro area seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 6.3%, up from 6.2% in July 2025 and stable compared with August 2024. On the other hand, the HCOB Eurozone Services PMI Business Activity Index rose to 51.3 in September from 50.5 in August. This suggested a fourth consecutive month of expansion, as readings above 50.0 indicate growth in

**In Asia**
Four deals exceeding US$50 million were priced in the Asian equity market last week, collectively raising US$0.8 billion.
Mainland Chinese stock markets advanced during a holiday-shortened week, with the CSI 300 gaining 2.0% for the period ended September 30. Markets were closed from October 1 to 8 for the National Day holiday and Mid-Autumn Festival. Buoyed by market anticipation of a Federal Reserve rate cut in October, the Hang Seng Index moved 3.9% higher.
Showing improvement for the second straight month, China's official manufacturing PMI rose to 49.8 in September from 49.4 in August. This was supported by the new orders index, which increased to 49.7 from 49.5, while the new export orders index also improved, reaching 47.8 from 47.2. In contrast, the official non-manufacturing PMI unexpectedly fell to 50.0, down from 50.3 in August.
To stimulate its slowing economy, China announced it would leverage 500 billion yuan ($70.25 billion) in policy-based financial tools to accelerate project investments, according to the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). The commission stated it is working with related parties to facilitate a swift disbursement of these funds to designated projects and will urge local authorities to speed up implementation.
**In the US**
U.S. equity markets recorded significant gains this week, recovering from the prior week's decline to achieve new record highs. The S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones respectively climbed 1.1%, 1.3%, and 1.1%. A U.S. government shutdown led to the postponement of official economic data releases. With the official data unavailable, market sentiment was shaped by the ADP payrolls report, which showed a decrease in employment for September. This development, signaling a weakened labor market, strengthened the case for additional Federal Reserve rate cuts.
The federal government shut down due to a budgetary deadlock between Republicans and Democrats, leading to the suspension of certain services and the furlough of around 750,000 employees. U.S. President Donald Trump indicated the shutdown could be an opportunity for workforce reductions. Investors largely overlooked the potential economic impact, with their attention centered on the postponed data, such as Friday's jobs report. An extended shutdown has the potential to postpone other vital economic indicators, including the September consumer price index (CPI) report scheduled for October 15, clouding the economic picture ahead of the Fed's late-October policy meeting.
In the absence of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) report, market participants looked to alternative labor market indicators. The September ADP data showed a loss of 32,000 jobs, well short of the consensus estimate of 51,000 jobs added. This sign of labor market frailty appeared to bolster market conviction regarding imminent Fed rate cuts.
The ISM Services PMI fell to 50.0 in September from 52.0 in August, missing the 51.7 projection and suggesting a stall in the crucial services sector. Conversely, the manufacturing PMI inched up to 49.1 from 48.7 in August; however, it was the seventh consecutive month the index remained below the 50.0 threshold that signifies expansion.
**In Europe**
Technology sector strength, combined with optimism over a potential U.S. rate cut, drove European markets upward this week. The UK's FTSE 100 Index and the pan-European STOXX Europe 600 Index advanced by 2.2% and 2.9%, respectively.
Headline inflation in the Eurozone rose on a year-over-year basis to 2.2% in September, up from 2.0% in August. The core rate remained stable at 2.3% year-over-year, matching the level seen over the previous four months. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde remarked that the risks to inflation are balanced in both directions. The widespread market expectation is that the central bank will not implement further rate cuts in 2025.
The euro area's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stood at 6.3% in August 2025, marginally higher than the 6.2% recorded in July 2025 and stable compared with August 2024. Separately, the HCOB Eurozone Services PMI Business Activity Index climbed to 51.3 in September from 50.5 in August, pointing to a fourth straight month of expansion, as readings above the 50.0 mark denote growth.
