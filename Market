China ## 

Mainland Chinese stock markets advanced amid sustained bullish sentiment among retail investors. The onshore benchmark CSI 300 Index rose 1.38%, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 1.52%. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index also increased, climbing 3.82%. The CSI 300 Index recorded the largest single-day advance since March on last Thursday, driven primarily by domestic technology companies perceived as key beneficiaries of Beijing’s initiative to promote homegrown innovation.

China’s USD-denominated trade surplus expanded to USD103.bn in August, up from USD98.24bn in July. Exports grew 4.4% year-on-year in USD terms, missing market expectations of a 5.4% gain and marking the slowest expansion since February. Imports rose 1.3% YoY, falling short of the 4.3% forecast and decelerating from July’s 4.1% growth.


The Producer Price Index (PPI) declined 2.9% year-on-year in August, marking the 35th consecutive month of contraction, but also representing a narrowing of the decline from July’s 3.5% drop


Data indicated that deflationary pressures persisted within China’s economy. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined 0.4% year-on-year in August, lower than market expectations of a 0.2% decrease. This decline followed July’s flat reading (0% year-on-year) and marked a return to negative territory. While food prices contributed to the weakness, the deflationary trend was also driven by broader factors including sluggish domestic demand and intensified price competition
